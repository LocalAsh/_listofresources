        <h3> List of lists of web resources </h3>
        <p> As developers it's no secret that we love resources so we can upskill ourselves or learn something new to achieve our goals, its even better if those resources are <b>FREE</b>.<br>
            <br> Great thing is that there's a lot of developers who spend their time collecting these resources for the community and It's something I really appreciate everytime I see it,
            I have collected a list of some of these lists that have been heplful to me and continue to be and I think they can be helpful to you too. <br><br>
            Go ahead and bookmark, save and share this website and come back to it whenever you like.
