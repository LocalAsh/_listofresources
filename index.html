        <hr>
        <p> As developers it's no secret that we love resources so we can upskill ourselves or learn something new to achieve our goals, its even better if those resources are <b id="free">FREE</b></p>
        <p> Great thing is that there's a lot of developers who spend their time collecting these resources and make lists of them for the dev community and It's something I really appreciate everytime I see it,
            I have collected a list of some of these lists that have been heplful to me and continue to be and I think they can be helpful to you too </p>
